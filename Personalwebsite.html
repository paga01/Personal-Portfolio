<h1>John Anthony Pagarigan</h1>
<p> Let’s start by how my friends and family calls me, my family calls me “john john” but my friends calls me “paga” I prefer being called by john John because It gives me flashbacks when I was still a kid who used to play outside without having a shower who is carefree and has a lot of time for friends and games!</p>
<p> I still remember a time I played all day and not going to shower because I’m s tired to take a bath. My childhood memories are the best I won’t forget every single moments of it. I studied at pateros catholic school since nursery to senior high, studying at a catholic school is such a privelage because It helps us understand about more things in the world. </p>
<p> It helps us to be a better person. It gives us a chance to learn and believe, because if we understand more we'll have more faith. Now in college I’m in a non Catholic school University of Makati. My course in college is Information Technology</p>
